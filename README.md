# Hoopium
Easily boost your Hoop diamonds by scraping your 'share for rewards' link.

## Requirements
#### Node Requirements
* [Nightmare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nightmare)
#### Others
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Working proxies (I recommend [Proxy Checker](https://checkerproxy.net/) and [Proxy Scraper](https://proxyscrape.com/free-proxy-list))
* String delimiter ([delim.co](https://delim.co/)) **OPTIONAL**

## Installation
* `git clone https://github.com/tinopai/hoopium.git`
* `cd hoopium`
* `npm install`
* Edit `config.json`
* `node index.js`
* ⚠️ Before running `node index.js`, you must edit the proxies and the URL located in `config.json`

## Recommendations
* Do not set more than 20 threads in `config.json`
* You don't need high quality proxies (as of 10/07/20)
* [Recommended User-Agent list](https://github.com/tinopai/others/blob/master/User-Agent%20List.md) (if you deem to change it)
